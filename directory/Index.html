<p>we like to collaborate with all sorts of filmmakers across the globe. we hope to increase our diversity and skills to give you the most relateable content to watch and enjoy. we are always looking to improve and be better storytellers</p>

<p>to someone who doesn't know Messenger films, we want the style to immediately be clear. When you hear the word messenger i want you to be thinking of delivering something. You might think of snail mail or something more historical. Thats why we chose the carrier pigeon as our logo/ mascot. As they used to deliver mail by carrier pigeon. When i describe the site, its just a homepage for the company. And information about our latest projects, and the crew and talent in the company. Again to reiterate, we want transparency, so we want the audience to know who is making what they watch, and for you to get to know them a little better. Thats us. Thats what we believe in. if i were to ask you about A24 studios, could you name a singler character or person in that company? Probably not. You know the name, and their films. Maybe a director On the other hand, Corridor digital is a good opposite. Everyone in the company appears on camera, tells their own story. Does their own thing. And it makes you learn more about them, and develop a sense of friendship. While the company is smaller, they create a parasocial relationship with their audience, creating a core fanbase for all their films. We want to do that for our audiences.</p>
